Our clients offer top-tier pay for top-tier talent. We're recruiting this role for our client, 2 Hour Learning. Have you got what it takes?

Are you a skilled full-stack developer with a passion for AI and a drive to transform K-12 education? At 2 Hour Learning, we're leading a revolution in digital learning backed by data and innovation.

At 2 Hour Learning, we don't just aim to improve education—we're redefining it. Our cutting-edge learning ecosystem, powered by advanced AI, learning science, and psychometrics, is twice as effective as traditional schooling. Students at every level, from kindergarten to high school, are achieving remarkable academic milestones, far surpassing standard expectations.

Your Role in the Revolution:

In this role, you’ll be at the forefront of our AI-powered educational transformation. With full autonomy and creative freedom, you’ll envision, develop, and deploy sophisticated full-stack applications and interactive AI tools that not only engage students but also enhance learning efficiency in unprecedented ways.

This is not a position for those who prefer to specialize in a single aspect of development. We're looking for innovative thinkers who can seamlessly integrate AI across both front-end and back-end systems, taking ownership of the entire product. Your work will directly impact thousands of students, ensuring that our tools meet their needs and set new standards for educational technology.

Who We're Looking For:

We need bold innovators who thrive on leveraging the latest in generative AI to create real-world educational impact. If you’re excited about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in AI-driven education and are ready to bring your expertise in full-stack development and AI, this is your chance to make a difference.

What You Will Be Doing

Develop AI-Powered Web Applications: Architect and code sophisticated web applications that integrate both front-end and back-end components, with a focus on enhancing user experience through AI.
Experiment and Innovate with AI: Work with cutting-edge AI technologies, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 or Claude, to create autonomous tools and interactive features that redefine how students learn.
Drive Technical Projects: Take ownership of the entire development process, from gathering requirements to launching and iterating on products. You’ll work closely with stakeholders to ensure that our solutions meet learner needs and push the boundaries of what’s possible.
Collaborate and Communicate: Partner with a global team of developers, designers, and educational experts. Your ability to communicate complex ideas simply and effectively will be key to your success.
Continuous Improvement: Stay ahead of the curve by continually learning and applying the latest advancements in AI and web development to our platform.

What You Won’t Be Doing

Narrow AI Development: You won’t be working on isolated AI features that don’t integrate with the overall product strategy. Your work will have a direct impact on thousands of students.
Surface-Level Coding: This is not a role for those who focus only on either front-end or back-end development. You will be expected to integrate both, creating comprehensive and scalable solutions.
Routine Maintenance: This role is not about maintaining legacy systems or making minor updates. You will be driving innovation and building new, cutting-edge applications.
Waiting for Detailed Specifications: You won't be handed fully fleshed-out requirements. Instead, you will take high-level ideas and translate them into fully developed products, leveraging your expertise in AI and full-stack development.
Working in Isolation: You won't be coding in a vacuum. Collaboration with other developers, product managers, and educational experts is key to ensuring that the solutions you build are impactful and user-centered.

Full Stack Engineer Key Responsibilities

Develop and deliver engaging, human-centered AI applications that demonstrably accelerate learning outcomes and efficiency for thousands of K-12 students.

Basic Requirements

At least 3 years of experience in full-stack development, with proficiency in front-end frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue.js, or Svelte, and back-end technologies like Node.js, Django, Ruby on Rails, Flask, or Spring Boot.

Proven ability to independently manage and execute technical projects from start to finish, including gathering requirements, development, deployment, and iteration.

Opportunity is not evenly distributed. Shopify puts independence within reach for anyone with a dream to start a business. We propel entrepreneurs and enterprises to scale the heights of their potential. Since 2006, we’ve grown to over 8,300 employees and generated over $1 trillion in sales for millions of merchants in 175 countries.

This is life-defining work that directly impacts people’s lives as much as it transforms your own. This is putting the power of the few in the hands of the many, is a future with more voices rather than fewer, and is creating more choices instead of an elite option.

About You

Moving at our pace brings a lot of change, complexity, and ambiguity—and a little bit of chaos. Shopifolk thrive on that and are comfortable being uncomfortable. That means Shopify is not the right place for everyone.

Before you apply, consider if you can:

Care deeply about what you do and about making commerce better for everyone
Excel by seeking professional and personal hypergrowth
Keep up with an unrelenting pace (the week, not the quarter)
Be resilient and resourceful in face of ambiguity and thrive on (rather than endure) change
Bring critical thought and opinion
Embrace differences and disagreement to get shit done and move forward
Work digital-first for your daily work


About The Role

Shopify empowers millions of merchants worldwide, simplifying complexities inherent in enterprise commerce. We cater to high growth, high volume merchants, providing the scalability, reliability, and flexibility they need to excel. As Shopify and the Partner ecosystem is rapidly evolving, and we're both building tools and experiences for some of the world's biggest brands. Partner Solutions Engineers play an integral role in this journey, and that's where you come in...

This directly contributes to accelerating revenue growth. By fostering close relationships with our Partners, you'll facilitate the seamless transition of top-tier merchants to Shopify, ensuring their needs are met, and their businesses continue to thrive.

You will have the opportunity to engage directly with our Partners, particularly their technical and sales teams. These interactions will involve high-level, solutions-focused discussions about the Shopify platform, their technology stack, and their merchants' overarching goals.

We would prefer a candidate to be based in Australia and this is a remote position, regionally-focused on ANZ, requiring occasional travel for on-site partner visits.

A passion for training and enabling others to excel.
Strong time management and prioritisation skills to handle multiple concurrent requests and the ability to re-prioritise on an ongoing basis.

Brief overview of this role:
We are looking for a full-stack software engineer to join our engineering team.
This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy with your work. Maybe you’ve worked in startups or had your startup that has finished up, and you want to join a team that moves very quickly and places a huge emphasis on product and engineering. Maybe you don’t have quite as many years of experience as others, but think you would do well at taking on more responsibility. Your level of experience matters less than your enthusiasm to take on more responsibility and make a significant impact.
You will have the opportunity to be a part of a small internal team working on greenfield projects and experimentation. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our Head of Product, CTO and CEO.

Employment:
Full-time
Based: Remote
Remuneration (Including Super): AUD $75,000 - 140,000 pending your level of experience
With Sitemate's diverse blend of remote and city-based team members, we ensure fair compensation regardless of your location. Our approach is informed by data sourced from Numbeo, the world’s largest cost-of-living database, which helps us maintain consistent remuneration standards across various regions.
Through our Cost of Living Multiplier, based on Numbeo's findings, we provide guidelines for adjusting salaries to reflect the cost of living in different cities. This ensures that all team members enjoy comparable living standards, no matter where they are based.

You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won’t need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.

Trust Radius: Dashpivot - By Sitemate Reviews & Ratings 2024

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in a new areas of Sitemate’s product suite that leverage AI, so you will get exposure to work with multiple products in our suite including our main product Dashpivot. This will entail developing and delivering features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality. You will also be getting involved in the planning and development of new features, including by joining research calls with project leadership.
Once you have gained familiarity with our products, you'll play a key role in developing new features, fixing bugs and re-architecting core component functions.
You’ll be working closely with our delivery team (Product Owner & QA Engineers), Product team and broader Engineering team on both delivering on projects and contributing to decision making around company-wide engineering issues.
You will assist our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.

What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?
Early stage projects - so there will be unknown unknowns
Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast
We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience

What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (ideally most but not all)
Javascript/Typescript experience, including Node and Angular, is preferred.
Love for all things Frontend including CSS.
MongoDB experience is a bonus.

"Programme Analyst, Gender-Responsive Governance, Dhaka (Only Bangladeshi Nationals are eligible to apply) - Dhaka","Dhaka, Dhaka, Bangladesh",On-site,Full-time,Mid-Senior level,"Background

UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.

UN Women in Bangladesh supports the government to implement commitments to international normative standards on gender equality and women’s human rights. The UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) 2022-2026, launched in 2021, and the corresponding UN Women Bangladesh Strategic Note (SN) 2022-2026, defines UN Women’s strategic engagement in Bangladesh. The country strategy focuses on strengthening the national structures and mechanisms for gender mainstreaming in policies, plans, and budgets; supporting efforts to prevent and eliminate violence against women; promoting women’s access to decent and safe work; promoting policies and government investment in women’s empowerment and resilience building in the context of climate change, humanitarian crisis as well as other threats to peace and security. UN Women works with a range of stakeholders in Bangladesh, including the government, civil society, women’s organisations, youth, UN agencies, and donors, to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment.

The Gender-Responsive Governance programme at UN Women Bangladesh, aligned with Outcome 3 and Outcome 4 of the UN Women Bangladesh Strategic Note (2022-2026) and Strategic Priority 4 and 5 of the UNSDCF 2022-2025, aims contribute to an environment where more people, especially the most vulnerable, benefit from more equitable, non-discriminatory, gender-responsive, participatory, accountable governance and justice, in a peaceful and tolerant society governed by the rule of law, and where women, girls and gender-diverse people are empowered to exercise their rights, agency and decision-making power over all aspects of their lives and are free from all forms of discrimination, violence and harmful norms and practices. In pursuit of this, the Gender-Responsive Governance Unit implements initiatives to advance the implementation of normative frameworks; gender-responsive planning and budgeting; gender statistics; women, peace, and security; and women’s participation, representation, and leadership.

UN Women works closely with the Government of Bangladesh, most notably with the Ministry of Women and Children Affairs (MoWCA) to uphold and implement its normative commitments to international treaty bodies, such as the Beijing Platform of Action (BPfA), Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) and its Concluding Observations, Commission of the Status of Women agreed conclusions, UN Security Council Resolution 1325, and gender equality related commitments of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). This also includes strengthening gender-responsive planning and budgeting to enable gender mainstreaming across all sectoral ministries and departments. In coordination with the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS), the Gender-Responsive Governance programme implements the global flagship programme initiative ‘Making Every Women and Girl Count’ to support the implementation and monitoring of the SDGs by strengthening how gender statistics are collected, analyzed, and used. The programme maintains a strong focus on supporting women’s participation, representation, and leadership in line with international commitments such as CEDAW, which upholds women’s right to participate in public life, and the (BPfA) which calls for removing barriers to equal participation. In line with the Leaving No One Behind (LNOB) principles, the programme partners with civil society to ensure that the voices of the most vulnerable women and grassroots women are included in decision-making, with an emphasis on inter-generational feminist leadership.

Reporting to the Deputy Representative, the Programme Analyst contributes to the effective management of UN Women programmes in Bangladesh by providing substantive inputs to programme design, formulation, implementation and evaluation. The Programme Analyst guides and facilitates the delivery of UN Women programmes by monitoring results achieved during implementation and ensuring appropriate application of systems and procedures and develops enhancements if necessary. The Programme Analyst works in close collaboration with the programme and operations team in Dhaka and Cox’s Bazar, UN Women HQ and Regional personnel, Government officials, multi and bi-lateral donors and civil society ensuring successful UN Women programme implementation under portfolio.

Job Summary

CARE is one of the world's leading international humanitarian and development organizations, committed to helping people in poor communities improve their lives and alleviate poverty. Founded in 1945, CARE is working over 100 countries to fight global poverty and marginalization. CARE has been active in Bangladesh since 1949 and is one of the largest programs in CARE confederation. Women and girls are at the core of all CARE programs because they represent half of the marginalized group and it is not possible to overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. CARE Bangladesh works to implement programs with long-term impacts that result in sustainable changes for the extreme poor and marginalized communities.

Bangladesh has made impressive strides in its social and economic development, achieving lower middle-income status in 2015 through stable macroeconomic conditions and substantial poverty reduction. The nation adeptly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining positive real GDP growth through prudent macroeconomic policies and effective stimulus measures. However, challenges persist, particularly for its youth population. With an overall unemployment rate of 8.9% among those aged 15-29, around 27% of this group is labeled as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Notably, this NEET issue is predominantly a gender concern as approximately 90% of NEET youth are female. Social norms emphasizing women's household roles and movement restrictions contribute to these disparities which is evident in the significantly lower female labor force participation.

The EARN Project in Bangladesh aims at economic engagement of the NEET youth, especially women, in rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The project offers education and skills development with a focus on women-centric facilities, employment and enterprise development support, enhanced employability through creating employer linkages and upskilling of Socio-Emotional Behavior (SEB) and Entrepreneur Development (ED) skill, incubation support for employment and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure participation of women and other underserved segment, the project will promote an enabling environment, especially for the women, through targeted awareness raising and communication programs, family-based planning, counseling and involving the communities and families in planning and monitoring of implementation.

In the case of Bangladesh, a country particularly vulnerable to climate change, there are several potential benefits, and specific conditions, including youth-centric ones, that can enhance climate co-benefit advantages. The project is designed for addressing climate change impacts and disasters. Bangladesh, in general, is increasingly being exposed to climate change-related hazards. The location of the project would be spread over many sub-districts, including extreme precipitation and flooding. Education and training programs have been severely affected by flooding in particular. The potential risks to education/climate resilient training facilities covered by the project due to flooding would be significantly reduced by the design of these facilities and the inclusion of soft components (e.g., training and awareness programs), which take flood risk into account.

The project will undertake climate resilience programs and enhance institutional capacity to improve the understanding of the responsiveness to disruptions from climate change and geophysical hazards. All skills development training will incorporate climate sensitization courses that will include adaptation and mitigation measures. The proposed competitive innovation funds will also be used to customize the new climate responsive awareness among the beneficiaries.

The Management Information System Expert has a key role in projects, overseeing systematic information and data management systems for projects, programs, and organizational performance.

The IRC has been present in Bangladesh since 2017 and obtained registration with the NGOAB in March 2018. Since the IRC obtained registration in March 2018, it has moved quickly to expand its integrated emergency health and protection response through both direct and partner-based programming focused on primary healthcare, women’s protection and empowerment, sexual and reproductive health, gender-based violence and child protection. Through 2018, the IRC’s response strategy will primarily target Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, while meeting the significant needs in both refugee and host populations, as already existing vulnerabilities are compounded with cyclical monsoon and cyclone seasons that impose additional threats to the lives and protection of those refugees as well as vulnerable host populations. IRC Bangladesh’s strategic vision is to protect, empower and meet the needs of the most vulnerable women, children and youth through technical expertise and partnerships in the areas of integrated protection, health, education and economic wellbeing before, during, and after displacement caused by conflict and climate-induced disaster. IRC will grow over time its geographic coverage within Cox bazar and to other parts of the country, thus expand its’ networks and partnerships around emergency preparedness and response work, reach beyond the Rohingya refugees, also targeting the vulnerable host communities in Cox Bazar and Southern parts of Bangladesh.

Working with Consensys puts you at the forefront of an evolving paradigm, transforming our society for the better. We fundamentally believe blockchain is the next generation of technology that can lay the foundation for a more just and equitable society.

Blockchain tech is just over 10 years old. Ethereum itself is still a toddler and we’re far from reaching our full potential. You’ll get to work on the tools, infrastructure, and apps that scale these platforms to billions of users.

You’ll be constantly exposed to new concepts, ideas, and frameworks from your peers, and as you work on different projects — challenging you to stay at the top of your game. You’ll join a network of entrepreneurs and technologists that reaches the edge of our ecosystem. Consensys alumni have moved on to become tech entrepreneurs, CEOs, and team leads at tech companies.

About Diligence

Consensys Diligence helps developers and smart contract architects to build more secure blockchain and smart contract applications. Our full remote team, distributed all over the world, is supporting the high demand for smart contract audits in the ever growing ecosystem. We are proud to help a fast growing list of clients, including major financial institutions, corporates and crypto / DeFi native companies such as Aave, 0x, Balancer, Uniswap, Status and many more.

Candidates should have a strong understanding of security primitives and be up-to-date with current exploits.

You will have the opportunity to work with and learn from some of the brightest minds in the space, to see how we approach hacking, threat modelling, scanning, auditing, designing and enhancing the security of smart contracts across the board.

Alongside client work, we also provide you with plenty of time for research and development efforts where you can push the state of the art and science of blockchain security.

Most of the work can be done remotely from wherever you are; little travel is anticipated (most of the team works remotely around the world). Along with a focus on technical excellence, we also believe firmly that culture and processes play an essential role in security.

We are looking for exceptionally intellectual, bright and technically driven individuals who can communicate their ideas clearly while working with clients to achieve their security objectives.

Experience developing and building on top of DeFi protocols or other smart contracts
Experience describing or assessing smart contract specific security risks

Background

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion are core principles at UNDP: we value diversity as an expression of the multiplicity of nations and cultures where we operate, we foster inclusion as a way of ensuring all personnel are empowered to contribute to our mission, and we ensure equity and fairness in all our actions. Taking a ‘leave no one behind’ approach to our diversity efforts means increasing representation of underserved populations. People who identify as belonging to marginalized or excluded populations are strongly encouraged to apply. Learn more about working at UNDP including our values and  inspiring stories.

UNDP does not tolerate sexual exploitation and abuse, any kind of harassment, including sexual harassment, and discrimination. All selected candidates will, therefore, undergo rigorous reference and background checks.

Signing of the Chittagong Hill Tracts Peace Accord in 1997 was a major political achievement, marking the end of a protracted low-intensity conflict in the region. One of the key government strategies outlined in the 8th Five-Year Plans is to fully implement the provisions of the Peace Accord. The government also aims at implementing accelerated development activities in the region. Despite these good intentions, the Chittagong Hill Tracts (CHT) still suffers from its remote location, diverse ethnic composition, and limited infrastructure, impacting essential services such as education, healthcare, and water access. Despite commitments, the CHT institutions haven't achieved their full potential due mainly to undefined roles and pending elections, hindering effective service delivery and regional governance. The unique biodiversity of the CHT, including forests, wildlife habitats, and waterbodies, is at risk due to the diversion of forest land for population and settlement growth, inappropriate agricultural practices, and climate change.

To continue the momentum of successful implementation of the Promotion of Development and Confidence Building in CHT project (2003–2016) and Strengthening Inclusive Development in CHT (SID-CHT 2017-2023), MoCHTA and UNDP, with assistance from a number of Development Partners, have undertaken a new project titled “Ecosystem Restoration and Resilient Development in the Chittagong Hill Tracts (ERRD-CHT)”. The project focuses on enhancing resilient ecosystems, development and governance in the CHT by building community and ecosystem resilience through various development and conservation outputs and activities. Support for resilient livelihoods and micro-enterprises will be combined while conserving ecosystems and biodiversity and improving local governance by empowering local communities, including women and youth and marginalized sections, and institutions in partnerships with the Government of Bangladesh (GoB), counterparts, traditional leaders, and development partners.

The ERRD-CHT Project Will Produce Results On Four Interlinked Levels, Thereby Strengthening The Ability Of The Population To Enhance Resilience, Development And Governance That Impact The People’s Lives And Livelihoods. The Main Objective Of ERRD-CHT Project Is “to Strengthen Gender-responsive Resilience And Development Through Improved Governance And Ecosystems, And Adaptive Livelihoods With Market Access.” Which Will Be Achieved Through The Following Four Outputs

Output 1: Improved and resilient forest ecosystems and livelihoods.

Output 2: Enhanced capacity and institutional building of the CHT institutions and strengthened democratic governance with increased people’s participation, responsive communities and more effective service delivery.

Output 3: Inclusive and gender-responsive learning and empowerment among women and girls.

Output 4: Enabled environment for self-reliant youth development and leadership.

The project will be implemented in all 121 Unions of 26 Upazilas in the three Hill Districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari and Bandarban. In the CHT, nearly 100,000 rural- and urban households will directly benefit from the project. It will include the extreme urban and rural poor and vulnerable groups, including women and youth.

Chittagong Hill Tracts Watershed Co-Management Activity II (CHTWCA II), funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), is part of Ecosystems Restoration and Resilient Development in Chittagong Hill Tracts (ERRD-CHT) - a project of the Ministry of Chittagong Hill Tracts Affairs (MOCHTA). Chittagong Hill Tracts Watershed Co-Management Activity II (CHTWCA II), within ERRD-CHT project, is being implemented with the goal: Strengthened gender-responsive local resilience through an integrated ecosystem management approach of the Chittagong Hill Tracts. CHTWCA II Outcome is to strengthen local resilience through an integrated ecosystem management approach that improves wildlife conservation and the governance of natural resources in the CHT.

Job Summary

CARE is one of the world's leading international humanitarian and development organizations, committed to helping people in poor communities improve their lives and alleviate poverty. Founded in 1945, CARE is working over 100 countries to fight global poverty and marginalization. CARE has been active in Bangladesh since 1949 and is one of the largest programs in CARE confederation. Women and girls are at the core of all CARE programs because they represent half of the marginalized group and it is not possible to overcome poverty until all people have equal rights and opportunities. CARE Bangladesh works to implement programs with long-term impacts that result in sustainable changes for the extreme poor and marginalized communities.

Bangladesh has made impressive strides in its social and economic development, achieving lower middle-income status in 2015 through stable macroeconomic conditions and substantial poverty reduction. The nation adeptly navigated the COVID-19 pandemic, maintaining positive real GDP growth through prudent macroeconomic policies and effective stimulus measures. However, challenges persist, particularly for its youth population. With an overall unemployment rate of 8.9% among those aged 15-29, around 27% of this group is labeled as NEET (Not in Education, Employment, or Training). Notably, this NEET issue is predominantly a gender concern as approximately 90% of NEET youth are female. Social norms emphasizing women's household roles and movement restrictions contribute to these disparities which is evident in the significantly lower female labor force participation.

The EARN Project in Bangladesh aims at economic engagement of the NEET youth, especially women, in rural and semi-urban areas of the country. The project offers education and skills development with a focus on women-centric facilities, employment and enterprise development support, enhanced employability through creating employer linkages and upskilling of Socio-Emotional Behavior (SEB) and Entrepreneur Development (ED) skill, incubation support for employment and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure participation of women and other underserved segment, the project will promote an enabling environment, especially for the women, through targeted awareness raising and communication programs, family-based planning, counseling and involving the communities and families in planning and monitoring of implementation.

In the case of Bangladesh, a country particularly vulnerable to climate change, there are several potential benefits, and specific conditions, including youth-centric ones, that can enhance climate co-benefit advantages. The project is designed for addressing climate change impacts and disasters. Bangladesh, in general, is increasingly being exposed to climate change-related hazards. The location of the project would be spread over many sub-districts, including extreme precipitation and flooding. Education and training programs have been severely affected by flooding in particular. The potential risks to education/climate resilient training facilities covered by the project due to flooding would be significantly reduced by the design of these facilities and the inclusion of soft components (e.g., training and awareness programs), which take flood risk into account.

The project will undertake climate resilience programs and enhance institutional capacity to improve the understanding of the responsiveness to disruptions from climate change and geophysical hazards. All skills development training will incorporate climate sensitization courses that will include adaptation and mitigation measures. The proposed competitive innovation funds will also be used to customize the new climate responsive awareness among the beneficiaries.

The Management Information System Expert has a key role in projects, overseeing systematic information and data management systems for projects, programs, and organizational performance.

The fundamental mission of UNICEF is to promote the rights of every child, everywhere, in everything the organization does — in programmes, in advocacy and in operations. The equity strategy, emphasizing the most disadvantaged and excluded children and families, translates this commitment to children’s rights into action. Nearly one million Rohingya refugees, with over 50 percent being children, reside in camps in the Cox’s Bazar District of Bangladesh and on Bashan Char Island. This population relies heavily on assistance provided by the humanitarian community whose work is aligned with the priorities of the Joint Response Plan (JRP). In response to the educational needs of Rohingya children, UNICEF and the Education Sector developed the 'Learning Competency Framework and Approach' (LCFA) during the initial years of the crisis. The Rohingya community expressed a strong desire for their children to access a formal education curriculum, which would provide a twofold outcome of providing a formal curriculum and facilitating seamless integration upon repatriation to Myanmar. The Myanmar Curriculum (MC) was piloted for Grades 6 to 9 in December 2021. Following the pilot's success, all enrolled children transitioned from the LCFA to the MC. By the end of July 2024, across the Education Sector, there were 244,836 learners (117,234 girls, 127,602 boys) in formal education following the Myanmar Curriculum. An additional 17,047 children in the non-formal ALP programme based on the Myanmar Curriculum. UNICEF is the leading agency in the education sector response supporting 10 implementing partners who provide education in 31 camps in Cox’s Bazar and in 19 schools in Bhasan Char. UNICEF’s direct programming contributes to more than 85 percent of the overall Education Sector achievement for the Myanmar Curriculum.

For the implementation of a formal curriculum, having sufficient numbers of trained teachers and improving teaching and assessment skills requires institutional systems, strong in-service teacher professional development programmes and the use of technology solutions for Education to contribute to overcoming some of the challenges. The UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office is strengthening Education programme activities in the Rohingya camps with the use of technology solutions to support learners, teachers, trainers, and implementing partners with meeting the standards of a formal curriculum. The Education section is specifically focused on developing teacher training programs and implementing technology solutions to contribute towards quality and resilient education delivery. The teacher training programmes are being developed in partnership with technical institutes in Bangladesh. The programmes will support teachers in grades 3 and above to develop their pedagogical skills and subject knowledge for the Myanmar Curriculum and for kindergarten to grade 2 teachers on foundational numeracy and literacy skills.

UNICEF is working on strategic and immediate areas for the use of technology solutions:

To improve instruction by providing multimedia teaching and learning materials.
To provide compelling teacher professional development facilitated through Learning Passport for blended teacher training.
To conduct learning assessment for supporting teaching at the right level with the use of assessment platforms aligned with Myanmar Curriculum assessment framework.
To provide a learning record per child which includes assessment data and attendance data.
To strengthen adolescent skills development and inclusive education.

How can you make a difference?

Under the guidance and general supervision of the Education Manager (P4) who leads the Education programme in Cox’s Bazar, the Specialist supports the development of teacher training programmes and the integration of technology into the Education Programme. This includes in teaching practice to connect pedagogy and technology use to improve teaching, as well as to facilitate and improve teacher professional development activities and in classroom administration. Other areas of EdTech use with the Rohingya population include with parents, caregivers and community members to increase participation and involvement in education; with school administration to support record keeping and the collection, analysis and use of data for decision making; for digitalised personal learning and to support adolescent girls’ education. This recognises digital literacy as a 21st century skill for adolescents to thrive in a transforming world marked by technology, migration, climate change, and conflict. Digital literacy encompasses a set of knowledge, skills, and attitudes that empower children in an increasingly digital world.

The Specialist is responsible for the planning, development, implementation, monitoring and reporting of EdTech initiatives and the establishment and implementation of two teacher training programmes within the Rohingya education response. The Specialist provides technical guidance and operation support, within UNICEF Cox’s Bazar Field Office, to ten Implementing Partners (IPs) as well as three technical partners. The Education Specialist will also be responsible for the development of two teacher training programs by providing technical guidance, providing quality assurance of the programmes, and ensuring operational feasibility of the programmes in the camps. The Specialist contributes to achievement of results according to plans, allocation, results-based management approaches and methodology (RBM), as well as UNICEF’s Strategic Plans, standards of performance, and accountability framework. The Specialist will line manage three positions (Gender Officer, Adolescent Skills Officer and a United Nations Volunteer (UNV) for Field Monitoring and Edtech).

 General Background

 

As of September 2024, Bangladesh hosts 1 million Rohingya refugees, 52% of whom are female, and 52% of whom are under the age of 18. Most refugees live in 33 extremely congested camps in Ukhiya and Teknaf sub-districts of Cox’s Bazar, and 35,510 reside on Bhasan Char, an island in the Bay of Bengal, 60 km from the Bangladesh mainland. August 2024 marked seven years since the Rohingya crisis when more than 700,000 Rohingya women, men, and children fled Myanmar to Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who sought and found refuge in the country in previous years. Yet, comprehensive solutions for Rohingya refugees remain elusive. While voluntary repatriation constitutes the main durable solution, a return in significant numbers in the immediate future is highly unlikely due to the ongoing developments following the military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 and the resurgence end 2023, of active armed conflict in Rakhine State where the million Rohingya refugees come from. Conditions in Myanmar are not presently considered conducive for the safe, voluntary, sustainable, and dignified return of Rohingya refugees.

With the escalation of the conflict in Northern Rakhine State since November 2023, the operation in Bangladesh has experienced the spill overs in the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. On the one hand, UNHCR and partners have been recording a significant increase in security incidents in the camps, including homicides and abductions. UNHCR has also seen an emerging trend of organized groups recruiting refugees to engage them in the armed conflict in Myanmar. The compromised civilian and humanitarian character of asylum in the camps has heightened risks for refugees, refugee volunteers (the backbone of the humanitarian response) and humanitarian workers. On the other hand, the operation has been recording new arrivals in the camps despite the Government’s closed-door policy at the border with Myanmar. New arrivals are extremely vulnerable, many have suffered injuries as they were fleeing; there are an estimated 30,000 or more new arrivals. The government has just authorized their assistance but without registration.

In response to the Rohingya refugee influx in 2017, the Common Feedback Mechanism (CFM) was established in Cox’s Bazar. To centralize information from the various channels (Helpline, Suggestions/Complaints boxes, dedicated email addresses, Complaints Feedback and Mechanism (CFM) desks), track UNHCR’s response to refugees, enhance information management and ultimately accountability to affected populations, the Centralized Automated Information Processing Platform (CAIPP) has been developed to facilitate this process. The pilot was launched in December 2023 in 5 camps, and CAIPP was rolled out in all 33 camps in June 2024. RAIS, the UNHCR corporate tool to manage tickets with its interface with proGres, is now being incorporated into CAIPP. The next phase will entail working on the inter-operability with other CFM systems in the Rohingya Refugee Response, notably IOM’s system as co-lead of the Joint Response Plan but also WFP, UNICEF and others. UNHCR is an active member of the AAP Technical Working Group hosted by the Inter-Sector Coordination Group (ISCG) and feeds into the discussions that will aim at enhanced collective accountability at the level of the whole response.

 

 Purpose and Scope of Assignment

The Associate Protection Officer (AAP) will be a member of the Community-Based Protection Unit in Cox's Bazar Sub-Office. S/he will report to the Protection Officer (AAP), who is the Head of the team managing the Helpline, all Complaint and Feedback Mechanism (CFM) Desks as well as Communication with the Communities (CwC). Under the supervision of the Protection Officer (AAP), the Associate Protection Officer (AAP) will:

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in one of our product teams. This entails developing features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality. You will also be getting involved in the planning and development of new features, including by joining research calls with project leadership.
Once you have gained familiarity with our products, you'll play a key role in developing new features, fixing bugs and re-architecting core component functions.
You’ll be working closely with our delivery team (Product Owner & QA Engineers), Product team and broader Engineering team on both delivering on projects and contributing to decision making around company-wide engineering issues.
You will assist our delivery team with diagnosing any production issues by investigating bugsnag and datadog logs, and then creating hotfix releases accordingly.

What will be the biggest challenges for me in this role?
Early stage projects - so there will be unknown unknowns
Pace - we move very quickly, so you’ll need to be excited to come in and learn extremely fast
We have a strong culture based on core values and standard operating procedures, you may need to unlearn a few things from previous experience

What kind of skills and experience do I need to have? (ideally most but not all)
Javascript/Typescript experience, including Node and Angular, is preferred.
Love for all things Frontend including CSS.
MongoDB experience is a bonus.
Experience with building no/low code automation product(s) is a bonus.
Broader non-technical understanding of the open API ecosystem, best practices and trends

Senior Full Stack Engineer [B2B] [SaaS],APAC,Remote,Full-time,,"👋 Thanks for stopping by and learning more about this role at Sitemate! ✨🏗️
We’d love to hear from you 👩‍💻👩🏽‍💻🧑🏿‍💻👨🏻‍💻

Brief overview of this role:

We are looking for a full stack software engineer to join our engineering team.

This role would be great for you if you are looking for more technical authority and autonomy with your work. Maybe you’ve worked in startups, or had your own startup that has finished up, and you want to join a team that moves very quickly and places a huge emphasis on product and engineering. Maybe you don’t have quite as many years of experience as others, but think you would do well at taking on more responsibility. Your level of experience matters less than your enthusiasm to take on more responsibility and make a significant impact.

You will have the opportunity to be a part of a small internal team working on greenfield projects and experimentation. You will have direct engagement, collaboration and communication with our VP of Product Strategy, CTO and CEO.

Employment:
Full-time
Based: Sydney, Australia / Melbourne, Australia / Remote (UTC-3 to PST-8 due to overlap requirements with the current team)
Remuneration (Including Super): AUD $140,000 - 180,000 pending your level of experience
With Sitemate's diverse blend of remote and city-based team members, we ensure fair compensation regardless of your location. Our approach is informed by data sourced from Numbeo, the world’s largest cost-of-living database, which helps us maintain consistent remuneration standards across various regions.
Through our Cost of Living Multiplier, based on Numbeo's findings, we provide guidelines for adjusting salaries to reflect the cost of living in different cities. This ensures that all team members enjoy comparable living standards, no matter where they are based.

Why should I consider joining Sitemate?

We have equal opportunity for applicants of all genders, ethnicity and sexualities - Sitemate's team is proudly diverse. 55% of our team identify as coming from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. 43% identify as female. Our team ranges in age from 22 to 51 years old.
You will have flexible working options - our team is a blend of fully remote and hub offices. People based in hub cities typically work in the office 2-3 days per week. Our remote team members are currently based in over 10 countries including Brazil, the Philippines, Kenya, Kazakstan, Indonesia, Venezuela, & Uruguay.
You will be remunerated based on your performance. If you are performing well, you won’t need to wait 3 years or have to find better offers elsewhere to receive an increase to your remuneration. 7 out of the last 10 remuneration increases for Sitemate team members have been made pro-actively by management, without the individual needing to even raise the topic of remuneration.
You will get a laptop and a budget to set up your home office (standing desk, monitor, headphones etc).
You will have visibility into the standardised career development plan for your role, and access to a professional learning and development budget.
You will get equity options and ownership in Sitemate on a standard vesting schedule. See here a general overview of how this works:https://legalvision.com.au/5-essential-elements-employee-share-scheme/
Sitemate has grown from 5 people in 2018 to now over 100, and we’re moving into the next stage of growth! We have a product that customers are strongly engaged with, and every month we get around >400 new leads whilst spending $0 on marketing and 0 cold calling.
Sitemate’s founders have diverse backgrounds - one coming from engineering on major infrastructure projects; the second coming from product and graphic design. This brings a unique perspective internally where we blend deep industry experience with a passion (obsession) for modern best practices in product design.

What is the working environment like at Sitemate?
We are very transparent - monthly Allhands meetings provide the team with direct insight into team updates, customer stories, hiring plans and key metrics (NPS, Revenue, Financial Performance). During this Allhands meeting we also hear one ‘life story’ from one of our team each month - learning about different countries and cultures around the world.
We place an extremely high value on your time - you won’t be spending your days wasting time on fighting internal systems, botched together spreadsheet processes or doing data entry.
We use best in class systems that are seamlessly integrated to deliver our team the right information at the right time, allowing them to get their work done efficiently and to a very high standard.
You will have a core and close team around you, but you will also be exposed to and working directly with multiple departments - engineering, product, design, marketing, sales and customer success.
You will have a high degree of autonomy, as the focus is on outcomes and not hours. If you want to block off a few hours to run a personal errand or block off an hour to pick up the kids from school - no worries. No one will be monitoring your time.
We are constantly working to minimise the number of group meetings - daily check ins are all done asynchronously (in your own time) each morning. But spontaneous 1:1s or small sessions are strongly encouraged!

What does Sitemate do, exactly?
Sitemate builds best in class software products for the built world.
Industrial companies operating in the built world are facing a number of mission critical challenges - changes in work behaviour as Generation Z start to enter the workforce as mobile first users of software, and the drastic shift away from traditional mining to renewable energy projects such as wind farms and solar farms.
Our first product - Dashpivot, is a platform where industrial style companies streamline and standardise their processes in a new digital format. This new digital format enables them to complete and track work in the field on a mobile or tablet, and automate repetitive tasks and tracking through automated workflows and real-time analytics.

Trust Radius: Dashpivot - By Sitemate Reviews & Ratings 2024

What will I be doing day to day in this role?
You will work as a Full Stack Engineer in one of our product teams. This entails developing features to address pain points for our customers and our go-to-market teams. Our current engineering and product processes enable us to ship multiple features each week.
For the first couple of months, you will pick up some ‘warm up’ tasks to help you familiarise yourself with our systems and processes, as well as our existing functionality.
